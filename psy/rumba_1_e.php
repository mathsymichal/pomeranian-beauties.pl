Rumba, our Black Pearl... Chosen from a litter of seven! We immediately knew that she would stay with us :-) Incredibly vivid, agile, little girl. And she grew up to be a beautiful, little lady! Always first to chase the ball, always first to jump over the fences that we use to protect our flowers! We very strongly hope that apart from an amazing character and cleverness she will also show herself great in dog shows!
