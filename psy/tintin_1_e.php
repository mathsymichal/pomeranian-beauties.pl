For a few years now we have been dreaming about keeping a black &amp; tan son of Darek and Fayla... A perfect couple, in love since forever. And then on the 28th of June 2014 Dayla gave birth to four puppies. It was her last litter, and among it was our black boy, our Tintin :-) Our little wonder!
 </p>

 <p>
He's just like we imagined him to be: beautiful, lovely, with an amazing temper and character. He loves us and loves the shows :-) He has already achieved his small (and a bit bigger) successes. But the biggest ones, as we hope, are still to come!
