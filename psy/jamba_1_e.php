On 19.07.2020 Unique Pomeranian Beauties \"Unia\" gave birth to seven puppies, the proud father was Jefferson de la Geode. Among those seves was Jambalaya, or \"Jamba\" as we call her at home... We very quickly decided that the little one will stay with us. She is a true spark, since the beginning always keen on cuddles and demanding them loudly... This has not changed! And in the meantime she also turned out to be a wonderful, loving mummy for her puppies!
