On the 4th of July 2014 our black pearl Rumba gave birth to four puppies, among which there were two black &amp; tan girls. The dad of these cuties is a beautiful dog Acaju de Passeriphane owned by Mr Jerzy Olszewski (<a href=\"http://www.sylena.pl/\" target=\"_blank\">Sylena Cavaliers</a>). From the very beginning we knew that one of them will stay with us. And she did... :-) Unique \"Unia\" - a small, clever, lovely and very joyful :-) Time goes bye and Unia is still our lovely, maybe a little shy, little girl, who conquered not only our hearts, but also the hearts of all those who know her!
