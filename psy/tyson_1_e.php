We have always had a great relationship with Roger Madec. Out of his kennel a while ago we got our wonderful Dark Cristal de la Geode, then a few years later Little Mec de la Geode, nd six years ago Jefferson de la Geode... We finally decided to ask Roger for a possibility to buy another boy, not related to the previous ones. And this is how two years ago Tyson de la Geode (born 01.05.2022) joined us. Extremely sweet boy, really reminds us of Dark Cristal, although he is ruby! But just like Dark Cristal he loves to have a cuddle, put his paws on our shoulders, nuzzling his face to our necks... And he sings :-) He loves us very much, we love him too <3 He is also a proud father of wonderful puppies which have achieved success at dog shows!
