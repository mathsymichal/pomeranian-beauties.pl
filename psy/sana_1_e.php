I have dreamed about a ruby or black and tan Cavalier for a long time. I started to call Polish breeders, what unfortunately convinced me that I won't buy my dream dog in Poland. In the year 2000 I met Mrs. Tanja Schuman at the Champions of Champions Show in Leszno. She was there with her wonderful dogs - Immenhof's Theresia (b&amp;t) and Anasthasia vom Oppermann-Schlößchen (ruby) - it was a love at first sight (of course with the dogs!). It turned out that Tanja is a very clever girl and we became friends very fast. Finally she gave me her phone number and e-mail and encouraged me to contact her. Soon I called and booked in Tanja's breeding - \"du chateau noblesse\" - a ruby or b&amp;t boy, a child of one of aforesaid bitches.

Unfortunately, Tanja had problems with her breeding for some time - covering of Anasthasia was empty and Theresia had Caesarean section made too late and puppies didn't survive. So that, I had to wait.

I think that Tanja commiserated with me and she contacted me with her friend Mrs. Elke von Malottki, who has also breeded Cavaliers for long time. She couldn't give me a boy which I was expecting, but a bitch - ruby! And what do you think I did? Of course I went for it immediately. So in September 2003 I had little princess XANDRA vom Oppermann-Schlößchen. Maybe you have heard that many cavalier ladies' owners call them \"princesses\". Do you know why? It's because each of them has something from a real princess inside - really! Sanka - we call her so at home - is a sweet, nice and always wanting to play girl. Our knees are the place she wants to be the most. We also noticed very fast, that she prefer to play with mascot rather than with squeaky toys.
