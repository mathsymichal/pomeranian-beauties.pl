In 2019 we managed to strike a deal with Mr Roger Madec (de la Geode cavaliers) who agreed to lend us one of his boys. Consequently, in March that year, a beatiful ruby boy Jefferson de la Geode came to stay with us :-) He immediately surprised all of us with his wonderful character which he showed as soon as he arrived, especially when saying hello to our boys. Jefferson is a 100% Cavalier, a very calm and peaceful dog. He is just wonderful! After a few months of his stay we decided that we cannot imagine him leaving us again - he became an integral part of our family! We are also confident that he himself loved being with us ;-) We started little negotiations with Roger. These took a moment but we finally arrived at a very positive conclusion! One of Jefferson's sons went to France to live with Roger, and our ruby boy stayed with us. We are sure that every single one of you who has had a chance to meet Jefferson can confirm he is worth every praise we give him! :-)
