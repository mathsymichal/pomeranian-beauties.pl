The first litter fathered by Jefferson at our place... The mum was Scarlett O'Hara \"Clara\" Pomeranian Beauties. Four puppies were born, two girls and two boys. We very quickly decided that Giogio (Georgia On My Mind) will stay with us! :-)

<b>JEFFERSON de la Geode</b></center>

 <p>
As our little ruby star approaches the 2 years old mark we have no doubt that there could have never been any other decision! She is such a full of life, clever, cuddly,  gorgeous girl, for which we are the most important in the world! Those big eyes following us around the house, expecting continuous admiration :-) The poses she takes on our laps are out of this world, as she clearly trusts us 100% that nothing bad can happen... Of course we will hold her head, catch her bum... There can be no doubt that every day with this wonderful and clever girl is a great day!
