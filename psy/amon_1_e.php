When we heard that at \"Sylena\" Gypsy Girl, a daughter of our Dark Cristal, gave birth to two boys whose dad was a beautiful and healthy (and tricolor!) boy Gayhalo Blackjack, we started chatting to the breeder Jerzy Olszewski about the possibility of having one of them. We watched them grow and develop together, and finally came the day when the decision was made - yes, AMON can be ours :-) Amon is a lovely dog, absolutely pleasant and sweet like a Cavalier should be, with a wonderful body... He develops so well! And that charming, loving look he has! You simply cannot resist him.

Amon has already achieved some wonderful dog show success. So far in junior class only, but we will soon move to more mature classes :-) He loves shows, adores people, and is loved not only by us, but also by all the dogs that live with us!
