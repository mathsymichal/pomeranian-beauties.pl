I've said that before, that we have a particular place in our hearts for Cavalier boys... And so we have decided to bring some fresh blood to our boysband! Consequently, we were recently joined by Sasha (Natali Teodorus Double Trouble For Rival). Sasha comes from Russia, his breeder is Ms. Natalia Varfolomeeva, a very lovely and responsible breeder.

Sasha is a gorgeous little boy. He is very keen on playing with other dogs, but his character is also strong! All the older boys are already under his spell, and so are we ;-) His best friend is Amon. Watching them play is our new favourite thing! :-)

Sasha will wait a bit before starting his show career. He needs more time than, e.g., Amon does. But we hope that we have a new beautiful star on our hands here! ;-)
