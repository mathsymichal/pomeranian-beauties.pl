Since August 2008 Royal Hero`s Harpo - father of our sweet Coca (Calypso) has been a member of our group! Harpo had spent earlier almost one year with us so we could find out how wonderful character this dog has. He had also entered a few Polish shows in that time and easily achieved the \"Polish Champion\" title. In August we have also showed him on the International Dog Show in Sopot where he reached his second CACIB :-). I hope that you will have a chance to see our boy on a lot of shows and check yourself if my opinion about him is correct :-)<br /><br />

We would like to thank a lot to Karin and Peter (breeding Royal Hero`s) that they have decided to give us the chance to look after Harpo. We can promise that we won't fail!
