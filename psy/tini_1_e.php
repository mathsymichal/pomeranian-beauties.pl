 Our life stories can unfold in an unexpected way, and the same applies to dogs! :-) This is probably why Tini, after a few months with Ula Koczkodaj, came back to us. It was meant to be this way... and it made us really happy! She's a daughter of our lovely Dayla, and of Darek as well :-) We trust that she will be happy with us as well, till the end of time... and even one day longer!
