Calypso, called simply \"Coca\" at home, is the first \"Pomeranian
Beauties\" cavalier to stay at our place. She's our sweet darling,
whom we helped to arrive at this world, who saw us when first opened
her eyes. We could watch her first clumsy steps and plays with her
brother and sister. We were the first to hear her voice and to feel
her wonderful pink tongue, when she licked us for the first time.
Believe us, that's a miraculous feeling for a breeder!
 </p>
 
 <p>
And we keep observing, how this little beauty evolves. In Coca's
pedigree You can find our favourite lines of one-colored Cavaliers,
such as Leelyn, Royal Hero`s, van Cavino and Harana. The whole litter
was directed to a wonderful ruby dog Myhope Fever. We are really
curious, how is Coca going to develop. We hope, that everything
will go just as well, as it is doing now. In this small bode You can
find everything, what breeder expects when planning a litter, dreaming
about some particular type of a Cavalier. Let's hope, that nothing
changes in the future!
