All my friends know that I particularly adore Cavalier boys... and this is why we finally decided to bring some fresh blood to our male-group :-) We decided to get a young boy with a very interesting pedigree, that suits the lines of our girls. We chose a French breeding \"de la Geode\" led by Mr. Roger Madec. When on the 12th of November a sweet b &amp; t girl Becassine de Sophline \"Babeth\" gave birth to six beautiful puppies, whose father is the fantastic Harana Marley, and two of which were b &amp; t boys - I knew that one of them will be ours! :-) Roger kept us informed about the babies' growth and our hopes were becoming more and more real!</p>

<p>In February 2009 Darek arrived at our home! This little boy got my heart from the very first moment I saw him. Rather small, full of temperament, courage and love. The flight attendants were absolutely delighted with his charm! And when we finally arrived home, Darek got everybody's love immediately.</p>

<p>Every day, week and month together brings us so much happiness, little boy's character is just amazing. Also our \"King\" Papa Joe is under his influence! If you could see, what Papa allows him for... It's incredible, Darek is the only one who has right to eat from Papa's bowl or \"push him out\" of the most comfortable part of the couch or from our knees :-) Darek is simply wonderful! This year we shall begin the showing adventure... We wil see, how this part of Darek's life goes.</p>
