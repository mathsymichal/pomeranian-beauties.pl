A little, beautiful ruby dog joined our group. His name is Royal Hero`s Fever my Hope and he was born on 25.09.2002. He's called Danny at home. Danny didn't fail our hopes, we've been showing him since May 2006 and he has already reached great results, he's also already a father of 4 sweet puppies. During those few months, that Danny has spent here with us, he has charmed us with his soft character and scooped our hearts, he has also made friends with the rest of our \"pack\".<br /><br />
 
We would like to say our thanks to Karin Voye, Danny's breeder, for the trust she has shown letting Danny stay with us!
