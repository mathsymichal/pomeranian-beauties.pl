We'd like to introduce our new \"family member\"! On the 21st of Semptember 2005 Norma Jean du chateau noblesse (FCI) joined our \"team\". This little princess was born on the 27th of June, 2005. Parents of our new beauty are: Leelyn BRIAR ROSE and Leelyn BELAIR - dogs imported from one of the most reputable breedings of one-colored Cavaliers in England.

Luckily, this 100% English girl was born in Germany in Tanja Schumann's house - our long lasting friend, very smart breeder of Cavaliers King Charles Spaniel, so now we can enjoy Norma's attendance in our house.

Norma Jean is a very sweet and lovely girl. She scooped our hearts in only a few minutes. Sanka and Papa Joe also learned how to love her, as probably nobody and nothing can object her charm. We hope that our little girl will follow the step of her parents and be a beautiful Cavalier lady.
 </p>

 <p>
We want to thank  Tanja Schumann - breeder of Norma Jean - for her trust, which she has shown when she gave us her little \"ruby - daughter\". Tanja - we ensure you that Norma found a loving house our and we won't fail your trust!
