A little b&amp;t girl, born on the 4th of December 2005, joined us in March. SILVER WOMAN comes from one of the best Dutch Cavalier breedings, which is 23 years old now - van Cavino. There were 7 beautiful b&amp;t puppies in the litter - 5 girls and 2 boys. All very similiar, perfectly colored, without even smallest white markings. Our \"Silly\" - this is the way her breeder, Mrs. Angela Nijland-Overkamp, called her - was chosen for us from this wonderful group. One of her sisters stayed in the breeding.

What can we say about our little girl? We are amazed by her smartness and charm. We are looking forward to the future! We hope, that she will be very successful at this year's shows!
