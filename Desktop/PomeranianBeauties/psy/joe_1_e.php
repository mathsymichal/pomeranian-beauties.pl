In the Ken Town's book one can read that Cavaliers don't like to be alone and if they don't spend a few hours during the day outdoors, you should think about buying next dog, because \"two cavaliers cost You only a bit more work, but when there is two of them they enjoy playing, running and simply living together.\" This sentence made me buy second Cavalier. I finally could fulfill my dreams!
 </p>

 <p>
I immediately contacted with Tanja, because she had Theresia - wonderful and gifted b&amp;t bitch. I was told that K'yra (that's how Theresia is called at home) was covered only a few days before. Tanja remembered about my dreams and promised me to choose a beautiful boy from this litter.
 </p>

 <p>
Could You imagine how impatient I was? Deep in my soul I asked  K'yra to make my dream come true. Tanja and I, both full of emotions, have been waiting for this delivery.

On the 20th of February 2004 we got great news! Theresia without any complications gave life to four healthy puppies, all b&amp;t - two bitches and two dogs. Tanja sent me their photos immediately. She gave them names and said to me: \"Now let's wait and see how they will develop.\". I had to wait for a few more weeks and I was so worried about their teeth, waited if their testicles come down. After a week Tanja said that one of dogs looks much better than the other. Each week made us more convenient, that Kentucky Joe du chateau noblesse will come to us! Every week Tanja was taking photos of her puppies and was sending them to us, so we could watch our little prince from the first day of his life.

And finally it was THAT day = the 8th of May 2004! Just after dawn we went for our precious! Sanka naturally went with us. And You know what, Papa Joe (this is how Tanja called him, his brother had been gone for a few days and Papa was an abolute leader since then) made friends with Sanka immediately! On our way home they were both sleeping on the rear seat of our car, nestled into each other. I think it was the last moment, when Papa was so good and calm...
 </p>

 <p>
In his first days at our home he \"ate\" half of our garden plants. Eg. our little magnolia, which already had some first leaves and all the tulips... What he didn't like, were coniferous trees. Running and playing with Sanka were endless. He loved to bite her ears or tail and run after her like that. It was the only way to prevent her from running too fast!

 <p>
When Papa was 6 month old, his playing with Sanka changed a bit. Papa had no more problems to catch her, even without \"holding\" her, also our plants could finally rest (unfortunately the magnolia didn't make it...). And our dogs can't live without each other anymore! They sleep nestled into each other (they really don't sleep with us!) and stay together all the time. When they finnish playing they lie on our knees, lick each other's eyes and mouths, they are simply marvellous! Watching them gives us so much fun! The way they behave, play, walks on the beach... Having a group of Cavaliers was a great idea not only for them, but for us too!
