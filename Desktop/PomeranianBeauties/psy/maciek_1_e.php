 When last year we had to retire our lovely \"Yulek\" from breeding we decided that a new boy should join our group! And we right away thought about Mr Roger Madec (de la Geode Cavaliers in France) who nearly 8 years ago entrusted DARK CRISTAL \"Darek\" de la Geode to us - our star :-), a lovely and healthy Cavalier. And so, in November 2015, LITTLE MEC \"Maciek\" de la Geode joined us. A sweet, beautiful Black &amp; Tan boy. He immediately found his place in our home, and even quicker - in our hearts! :-)
