When we planned to have puppies from our Silka (Silver Woman) and Danny (Fever my Hope), our Interchampion,
we hoped to keep a b&amp;t boy from this litter. But life is life and you can never be certain about some
things. Therefore when the only baby born was a ruby girl we didn't hesitate what to do. We were sure, that
she would stay with us... and that's exactly what happened! Our ruby treasure has been with us for 8 months
now and she's really exceptional - how on earth does she know that she's our \"one and only\"? :-) She can
do no wrong as everthing will be forgiven... really :-) She has a wonderful character, so full of charm,
that you simply must smile looking at her! It's something you would have to experience yourself to
fully understand my words :-)
