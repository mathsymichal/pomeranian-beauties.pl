For many years we have been maintaining a \"Breeding Book\"... We keep all matings there, births of puppies and their daily weights. But also, their prospective names! Under \"S\", quite a while ago, I put the name \"Scarlet O'Hara\".

 <p>
And when on the 30th of March 2013 our Casia (Cassandra vom Paulinenhof) gave birth to five puppies, there she was among them, our ruby princess Scarlet O'Hara \"Clara\" :-) So cute and sweet little darling. Always playful, ready for cuddles, looking at us with these big loving eyes.
