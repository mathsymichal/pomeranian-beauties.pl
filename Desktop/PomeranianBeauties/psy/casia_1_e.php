When You start breeding dogs, You become more and more interested in their pedigrees, ancestors, etc. You make plans for the future and check other breeds' home pages analyzing, which line would \"fit\" Your dogs best.

That's just how I found a very interesting planned litter in Heidi and Dieter Junghans' breeding <a href=\"http://www.cavaliere-vom-paulinenhof.de/\" target=\"_blank\">\"vom Paulinenhof\"</a>.The future parents were Ustje vom Paulinenhof and Harana Starmann. In their pedigrees I found lines like Harana, Leelyn, Rheinwelt and van Cavino. That was just what I was looking for!

This is the way how a sweet ruby Cassandra (called \"Casia\" at home) came to us. We loved this little girl when we just saw her photos, but that was nothing comparing to the impression she made, when we met her for the first time. Casia is a real quicksilver and fights bravely for her place in our group. Fortunately, her charm and these incredible black eyes make her so irresistible, that she doesn.t have to fight so much!
