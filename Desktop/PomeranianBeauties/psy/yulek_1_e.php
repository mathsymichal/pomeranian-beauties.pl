Yulek came to us last Autumn, being 15 weeks old... This little, clever ruby boy
immediately became our beloved one, and also our other dogs' best friend! Yulek has
done his best to be as nice, kind and friendly as possible to everyone around. He
showed the necessary respect to the older boys and was the truest gentleman to all
the girls in our house. And this is exactly how he remained! We are so, so happy
to have this amazing young \"man\" around!
