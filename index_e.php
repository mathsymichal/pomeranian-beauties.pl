		<p>Welcome to everyone who pops on our site about these wonderful dogs: Cavalier King Charles Spaniels! If you dream about a dog, which will be fully devoted to you, implicitly in love, which will want your proximity all the time, will be a a companion in children's plays, will become a playmate during walks or if you want only a friend, which you can hug when you're feeling down, no matter if you live in a city or in a country, in a block of flat or in a big house with a garden: this is the breed you're looking for!</p>

		<p>It is difficult to find a monograph of this breed in the Polish books collection. Certainly it is because it's not very popular in Poland. So all of proprietors of Cavaliers use German, English or Czech books. I don't want to tell you the whole story of Cavaliers or speak about their standards, but I quote a few sentences of Ken Town's book, who has been raising this breed for 30 years, has exposed dogs and is also a Kennel International Judge of this breed.</p>

		<p>In 1928 during the Crufts Dogs Show in England Cavalier King Charles Spaniel's Club was established. On the basis of hundreds of pictures of Cavaliers and the dog named Ann's Son, which was treaten as a living model, breed's standard was agreed. All the details were given some points, summary 100. Dog's head was found the most important: eyes, ears, shape of cranial vault: were attached 55 points! In \"general impression\" the biggest emphasis was put on activity, fitness and bravery of a dog.</p>

		<p>Now (since 10th of March, 1988) the ruling standard of Cavaliers is described as the number 136. FCI and still in \"general impression\" it is said about activity, bravery and good-tempered character and additionally about \"soft expression\". Head is still found very important, \"almost flat skull between the ears, flat alloy, big round eyes, long ears, which are situated high on the head, hirsute abundantly, full scissors standing occlusion\". There are obviously requirements for each detail but I don't want to bore you!</p>

		<p>The most popular color, not only in Poland, is blenheim: a pearly white ground with well-distributed chestnut-red markings. Markings should be divided evenly on the head, with a characteristic kissing spot between the ears.</p>

		<p>Tricolor: well-spaced and well-distributed black and white markings with tan markings above the eyes and on the cheeks, inside of the ears, inner legs and underside of the tail. Lack of brown markings is a fault and too big black spot are not desired.</p>

		<p>Our most favorite colors are ruby and black and tan, called 'wholecolours'.</p>

		<p>Ruby: solid, rich red. White markings are not allowed.</p>

		<p>Black and tan \"b&amp;t\": raven-black with tan markings above the eyes, on the cheeks, inside of the ears, chest, legs and underside of the tail. White markings are not allowed.<br />&nbsp;</p>
