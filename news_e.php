<b>10.02.18</b> - The new showing season has already started and we still haven't told you what happened for us in late 2017. Let us catch up then!<br /><br />

We are very happy to say that 2017 was very successful for our dogs. Our TINTIN Pomeranian Beauties became an Interchampion! LITTLE MEC \"Maciek\" de la Geode became a Champion of Poland and then, at the Club Show in Tallin in Estonia (with 186 Cavaliers competing) he was awarded the Best B&amp;T Dog title, came 3rd in Best In Show, and became a Champion of Estonia! He has also satisfied all requirements to become an Interchampion.<br /><br />

Our ruby girl TINY DANCER Pomeranian Beauties became a Champion of Poland and of Bulgaria in 2017. And our lovely DARK CRISTAL \"Darek\" de la Geode became a Veteran Champion of Poland :-)<br /><br />

We have also had one very sad thing happen to us... After two years of fighting and slow recovery, our RUMBA has passed away. She just fell asleep... Maybe she wass tired of this constant battle...?<br /><br />

But we want to finish on a very happy note! On the 6th of January 2018 our SCARLET O'HARA \"Clara\" and LITTLE MEC \"Maciek\" de la Geode became parents of five lovely puppies - two boys (one B&amp;T and one ruby) and three girls (two B&amp;T and one ruby). The puppies are growing and developing wonderfully, and Clara is being a perfect mum, just as she was in the past!<br /><br />

Firstly, the shows. We managed to present our \"Yulek\" (Royal Hero's You Are So Beautiful) a few times in middle class (the results are as usual available on his page) and this way our ruby boy officially became a stud dog! :)<br /><br />

Secondly, our little girls grow and we would like to introduce them to you: ruby \"Visa\" (One Vision Pomeranian Beauties – Norma Jean du Chateau Noblesse &amp; Dorian Gray of Woodville) and our black pearl Rumba Pomeranian Beauties (Cassandra vom Paulinenhof &amp; Dark Cristal de la Geode). Visa has already started her showing career and Rumba is about to begin it soon... so we shall probably participate in more shows this year than we did in last :)<br /><br />

<b>12.08.12</b> - It's high time to update you again with some news from our house, it's been a very long time since our last meeting! I have to admit that we slightly neglected dog shows this year, but many of our \"descendants\" are competing so we are following their results and we're cheering for their achievements!<br /><br />

But first of all we would like to introduce our new inmate to you. It's a beautiful ruby boy Royal Hero's You Are So Beautiful, which we call \"Yulek\". Yulek came to us already some time ago from our friend Karin Voye's kennel in Germany. From the very beginning he became a great friend with all our dogs, and our beloved one as well! With Darek and Visa (who we shall introduce in the next paragraph) they are an inseparable triple of friends. Recently he also started to try his luck in dog shows, but more about that, about his pedigree and some more photos of him are soon to be found in his page which we are working on at the moment.<br /><br />

<center><img src=\"./yulek0.jpg\" alt=\"\"></center><br />

And what else? Well, we were lucky to enjoy our Norma having a wonderful puppy! A sweet ruby girl One Vision (\"Visa\") was born on the 4th of April 2012. Her dad is a beautiful Tanja Schumann's dog Dorian Gray of Woodville. Visa stayed with us and has even already entered some shows - we showed her at a national dog show in Gdynia, where at the age of 3 months and a few days she became the Best Puppy!<br /><br />

<center><img src=\"./visa0.jpg\" alt=\"\"></center><br />

Also Dayla (Daylight Pomeranian Beauties) gave us a puppy! On the 25th of May she gave life to a black &amp; tan girl. The dad is our \"Black Prince\" Dark Cristal. The little Balbinka (Pink Panther Pomeranian Beauties) has already finished 10 weeks and last Sunday she went to live with Klaudia and Łukasz, her new family who live near Czestochowa. They are wonderful young people who already have one of our previous puppies Matysia (Irish Coffee Pomeranian Beauties). Every breader could only dream about such wonderful people to look after their puppies! We are sure, that our little ones are happy with them!<br /><br />

<center><img src=\"./balbinka0.jpg\" alt=\"\"></center><br />

And now the most recent news! Casia (Cassandra vom Paulinenhof) with Darek (Dark Cristal de la Geode) really did their best! :-) On the 28th of July 2012, in 4 hours, Casia gave life to seven puppies! There are three boys (2 ruby and 1 b&amp;t) and four girls (3 ruby and 1 b&amp;t) sleeping next to Casia now. The babys are growing healthy and getting stronger nicely which is not a surprise with such a caring mummy as Casia! A bit more about the puppies, together with some photos, can be found in their page. Come and have a look!<br /><br />

<center><img src=\"./psy/puppies/puppies0.jpg\" alt=\"\"></center><br />

The last piece of news is that we have finally received Darek's Interchampion diploma! We also took Darek to Olsztyn to the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine of the University of Warmia and Mazury. It was checked with an MRI scan that our Black Prince is SM-clear (\"A\")! We are very happy with that news! Well, and just as every time, come and have a look at our Photo album! :-)

All our dogs won their classes collecting CWCs, while Danek additionally was awarded the \"Best Veteran\" title :-)<br /><br />

What's even more important, many young Pomeranian Beauties attended the show as well! Hey Jude Pomeranian Beauties (Calypso P.B. &amp; Rebhan Raymond) entered the Middle class and won it otaining a CWC, and eventually also the \"Winner\" title. \"Hermes\" King of Hearts Pomeranian Beauties (Calypso P.B. &amp; Royal Hero's Fever my Hope) entered the Junior class which he also won together with the \"Junior Winner\" title. \"Dzem\" Jameson Pomeranian Beauties (Norma Jean du chateau noblesse &amp; Royal Hero's Harpo) in the Middle class took 1st place with a CWC. Finally, little \"Miodzio\" Muddy Waters Pomeranian Beauties (Cassandra vom Paulinenhof &amp; Dark Cristal de la Geode) entered the Baby class but... probably the stress didn't let him show his best, but this kid looks wonderful! :-) We are grateful to all the owners of those little Pomeranians and we congratulate you for your wonderful results!<br /><br />

Notting Hill, a b&amp;t boy, went to Tczew with Mr. Darek, Mrs. Żaneta and their three great sons: Michał, Tymoteusz and Cezary. We are sure that these Amazing Three and \"Notti\" will be wonderful friends!<br /><br />

<center><img src=\"./psy/puppies/nmiot/nottus0.jpg\" alt=\"\"></center><br />

Neytiri, a black girl, moved to Kraków to live with Natalia and, one day, also with Sebastian. Their love and attention seems to be so strong that it will surely replace well all that this little girl was receiving at our place!<br /><br />

<center><img src=\"./psy/puppies/nmiot/neytiri0.jpg\" alt=\"\"></center><br />

A ruby boy, called Nobleman \"Nobelek\", will be bringing joy to te life of Mrs. Ania from Słupsk. His companions shall be Ania's grandsons Michał and Kuba, and her son with his wife Wanda and their Labrador Atos. That sounds like a lot of fun!<br /><br />

The show was organized by the CCD club and was two days long. My companion was obviously our Darek (Dark Cristal de la Geode) who entered the open class.

On Sunday the judge was Dr. Zsuzsanna Vaczi-Balogh from Hungary. This time Darek had one competitor and again won his class so we came back home with two CAC's - that was a tiring but very rewarding trip! The atmosphere was simply wonderful and really encouraging to participate in those shows!<br /><br />

What else? After two months we have puppies again! On the 31st of July our Casia (Cassandra vom Paulinenhof) gave birth to five babies! Their daddy is...

The show on Sunday the 19th gathered 36 Cavaliers and the judge was Dr Andreas Schemel, an Austrian living in the UK. This time I showed Darek in the Open class - he took the 2nd place with note Excellent and was awarded res CAC CCD and res CAC VDH, competing with 4 dogs. But as this show has a high rank there was an additional competition - choosing the most beautiful dogs in all four colours. Darek managed to qualify for that one and won it!

<b>12.12.10</b> - And again long time has passed since we updated our website for the last time. But there is so much going on, especially in Michał's life, who as you know looks after our website... I would really like to add one more page to our site, especially about Michał, his present life is so interesting and filled with amazing trips... but I'm not sure if Michał would be glad if that happened, we will see!<br /><br />

But let's go back to our dogs, they have travelled a bit with Witek in the meantime, visiting some shows. On the 6th of November 2010 Dayla and Darek went to Poznan to participate in the Inrernational Dog Show. The judge was Ms. Zdenka Jilkova from Slovakia. Darek (Dark Cristal de la Geode) took 1st place in the Open Class, was awarded CWC, CACIB and... BOB too! :-) Dayla (Daylight Pomeranian Beauties), who also entered the Open class, also took 1st place with a CWC :-) Witek came back home from that trip extremely happy!<br /><br />

<center><img src=\"./bobPoznan.jpg\" alt=\"\"></center><br />

Two weeks later another long trip... to a two-days long International Dog Show in Minsk, Belarus. This time Witek took Darek (Open class) and Harpo (Champions' class) with him. On Saturday, the 20th of November, the judge was was Mr. Alexsey Belkin from Russia. Both Darek and Harpo took 2nd places with notes Excellent.<br /><br />

<center><img src=\"./legionowo0.jpg\" alt=\"\"></center><br />

On Sunday, when the judge was Mr. Anatoliy Zhuk from Belarus, Darek took 1st place in his class and a CAC... and in the final got a resCACIB, losing only to an Interchampion... Harpo in his class took 2nd place with note Excellent.<br /><br />

<center><img src=\"./legionowo1.jpg\" alt=\"\"></center><br />

Last Sunday, on the 5th December 2010, Witek went to... Nowa Huta, nearly to the other end of Poland! This time, after last year's Coca's (Calypso Pomeranian Beauties) success, which finished her Polish Champion there and won the BOB, the trip wasn't so successful. Both Darek (in Open class) and Dayla (in Open class) ended the show taking 2nd places with notes Excellent. The judge was Mr. Petr Rehanek from the Czech Republic. Well, that's just life, isn't it? For us our dogs are wonderful anyway, but the judges have right to their own opinions and we shuldn't argue with them :-)<br /><br />

<center><img src=\"./legionowo2.jpg\" alt=\"\"></center><br />

And as we are telling you so many news, there is also a very fresh and good one: today, on the 11th of December, on a National Dog Show in Nowy Dwór Mazowiecki, our \"couple\": Dayla and Darek, finished their Polish Champion titles! :-) Darek entered the Open class, got 1st place, CWC, a \"Winner\", and then Dayla in Open class repeated all his achievements and finally... has beaten Darek and got the BOB! :-) The judge was Mr. Wiesław Boryczko - what a wonderful day, despite such a bad weather!!<br /><br />

The last weekend was also incredible. On Saturday 18.04.2009 we took part in the national dog show in Grudziadz. The judge was Mr. Jerzy Olszewski. It was the debut for the little Emmanulle Pomeranian Beauties in the Puppies class. Both Emmanuelle and her owner Agnieszka did very well, thanks Agnieszka! We took our Pomeranian girls - Dayla in Junior class (4 girls registered, 3 present) and Coca in Middle class (2 girls registered and present).<br /><br />

<center><img src=\"./grudziadz0.jpg\" alt=\"\"></center><br />

We had a very good beginning - Dayla won her class and became Junior Winner. After that Coca - another big joy as she got 1st place with grade Excellent and CWC! But that's not all :-)<br /><br />

<center><img src=\"./grudziadz1.jpg\" alt=\"\"></center><br />

When the final part came the best adult dog, best adult bitch, junior dog and Dayla entered the ring. After a few rounds the Judge decided - Dayla is the Best Junior and... BOB! You must feel the happiness and pride - Dayla's first Polish show and such a success!<br /><br />

<center><img src=\"./grudziadz2.jpg\" alt=\"\"></center><br />

Finally the Spring came and it's time for some photos of our pets having fun in the garden! It's a wonderful time for them and us, it's such a pleasure to watch them playing together, chasing butterflies and bees! Even Tymon decided to take the adventure and plays with the dogs in the garden! More photos can be found in our Photo album!<br /><br />

On Saturday we have been showing our little Pomeranian Beauties on a club show, where the judge was Mr. Robert Payne from Great Britain. There were 50 Cavaliers registered in the competition. Our \"team\" was supported by Michal and Tola, his girlfriend, who came to Berlin and it was probably them who brought us luck! Dayla, on her first show ever, entered the Junior Class and took 3rd place in the competition of 8 girls achieving grade Excellent. What is more, as she was the best ruby girl, she also received JCAC, the Junior Champion certificate :-)!<br /><br />

Coca entered the Middle Class and, among 6 girls, also took 3rd place with grade Excellent! It was a great day, as not only the atmosphere was fantastic, but also we met many goodfriends... There is something special about those German clubshows :-).<br /><br />

On Sunday we participated in the International Dog Show where 53 Cavaliers were registered. The judge was Mr. Picard from the Switzerland. Dayla entered the most popular Junior Class (14 girls) and received grade Very good for, as the judge said, too puppy-like impression. Tola and Michal were not with us that day, that's probably the reason... ;-)<br /><br />

And what about Coca? That day once again shee took 3rd place with grade Excellent :-)! We spent a very nice weekend, the atmosphere was perfect, dogs were beautiful and our girls were beautiful :-) We are as always very, very happy!<br /><br />

Well, our girl didn't receive any award, but she was one of only ten to receive grade Excellent from Mrs Claydon! We are very proud of her, as she received a wonderful description and we are sure, that when she get more experience, she will give us even more cheer!
